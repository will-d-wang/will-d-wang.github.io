## Problems

How to find cross reference?
How to find issues earlier?
How to use debugger?

## Scanner build

Scan for mistakes, security issues and Vulnerabilities.

## Sensitive Information Scan

The Sensitive Information Scan (SAS) phase scans the code for sensitive information (e.g. hardcoded password, tokens, secret keys, etc) before pushing the code into code repositories.

## Static Application Security Testing
>
> The Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is done to identify the possible vulnerabilities or security issues in non-running source code by using techniques likeTaint Analysis and Data Flow Analysis.

### Why is it important in DevSecOps?

> The Static Application Security Testing phase can be used to identify security issues. For example, taint analysis can identify the variables that can handle the user input and check if vulnerability like buffer overflow can occur.
