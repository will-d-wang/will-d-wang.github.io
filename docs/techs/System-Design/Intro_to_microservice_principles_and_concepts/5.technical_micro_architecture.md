# Techincal Micro Architecture

## Factors that influence the technical Micro Architecture

- Communication
- Resilience
- New Microservices
- Operation
  - logs
  - metrics
  - configuration
  - deployment

## Reactive Programming

The [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) defines the term “reactive” based on the following characteristics:

### Responsive

- **Responsive** means that the system **responds as fast as possible**.

### Resilient

- Because of **resilience** the system **remains available** even if parts fail.

### Elastic

- The system can deal with different levels of load, for instance by using additional resources. After the load peak subsides the resources are freed again.

### Asynchronous communication

- The system uses asynchronous communication (message-driven).

[reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) means something completely different. This programming concept resembles the data flow

## Reactive programming and the reactive manifesto

## [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

### Communication APIs

- REST - By default

- JAX RS API

- Java Messaging Service(JMS)
- [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/) with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Spring Cloud Streams](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) supports messaging systems such as Kafka, RabbitMQ (see above) and [Redis](https://redis.io/).

### Operations

- Deployment - JAR file
- Configuration: application.properties
- [logs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html) or JSON data to server.
- Metrics: [Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/reference/html/production-ready.html)

## Go - Speed and concurrency

[Moving to Microservices: Top 5 Languages to Choose From](https://rubygarage.org/blog/top-languages-for-microservices)

[Go vs. C: A Language Comparison of Concurrent Programming Features](http://dead10ck.github.io/2014/12/15/go-vs-c.html)

### Communication: REST, [AMQP](https://github.com/streadway/amqp) , [Redis](https://github.com/go-redis/redis)

### Operation

- Deployment: docker multi-staging
- Configuration: [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for both JSON and YAML
- [logs](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log)
- Metrics:  [Go Kit](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit), Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB

### Resilience

resilience patterns such as [Circuit Breaker](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/circuitbreaker) ,  [Hystrix library](https://github.com/afex/hystrix-go)
