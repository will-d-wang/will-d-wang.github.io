# Pastebin

Let's design a Pastebin like web service, where users can store plain text. Users of the service will enter a piece of text and get a randomly generated URL to access it.

## Requirements

### Functional

* Creation: Upload or paste data and get a unique URL.
* Read: users can get the data by the URL.
* Data and links have expire data, users can specify the expire time.
* Users can pick up custom alias

### Non-Functional

* Reliable data, should not be lost.
* Real-time access with minimum latency
* The link should not guessable.

### Extended requirements

* Analytics. How many times a paste was accessed?
* REST API
* Size limit 10 MB
* Custom URL limit.

## Capacity Estimation and Constraints

* Traffic

* Storage
* Bandwidth
* Memory

## System API

addPaste(api_dev_key, paste_date, custom_url=None, user_name=None, past_name=None, expire_date=None)

getPaste(api_dev_key, api_paste_key)

deletePaste(api_dev_key, api_paste_key)

## Database Design

Schema

Paste: URLHash, ContentKey: char[], expiredate: datetime, userID: int

User: Name : string, email: string, creation_data: datatime, lastLogin: datetime.

## High Level Design
