A use case model is a set of use cases.

### what are use case diagrams used for?

* Prioterize requirements.
* requirements elicitation

* Architecture defines the form.

## iteractive and incremental

* Give developers early feedbacks
* Mimize the risk of developing wrong system
* Accomdate evolving requirements
