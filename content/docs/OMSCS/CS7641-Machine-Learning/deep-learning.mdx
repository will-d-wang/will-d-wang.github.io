In an interview last week, AI pioneer Geoff Hinton said -
[“Deep learning is going to be able to do everything”](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/03/1011616/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning-will-do-everything/)

> And if we have those breakthroughs, will we be able to approximate all human intelligence through deep learning?
>
> Yes. Particularly breakthroughs to do with how you get big vectors of neural activity to implement things like reason. But we also need a massive increase in scale. The human brain has about 100 trillion parameters or synapses. What we now call a really big model, like GPT-3, has 175 billion. It’s a thousand times smaller than the brain. GPT-3 can now generate pretty plausible-looking text, and it’s still tiny compared to the brain.
>
> When you say the scale, do you mean bigger neural networks, more data, or both?
>
> Both. There’s a sort of discrepancy between what happens in computer science and what happens with people. People have a huge amount of parameters compared with the amount of data they’re getting. Neural nets are surprisingly good at dealing with a rather small amount of data, with a huge number of parameters, but people are even better.
>
> Deep learning has come a long way in the past few years and changed a lot of minds including Geoff Hilton's.

Here are some good resources to get started on Deep Learning:

1. [Deep Learning](https://amzn.to/3nga6Ma) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville - This book by the founding fathers of deep learning will help cover all the theoretical elements and have a solid understanding of the fundamentals.
2. **[Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD](https://amzn.to/36CBdKV)** by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger - This is a very practical book with lots of code samples.
3. [Deep Learning with Python](https://amzn.to/35t7Qew) by François Chollet - This is another practical book with tons of code samples.
