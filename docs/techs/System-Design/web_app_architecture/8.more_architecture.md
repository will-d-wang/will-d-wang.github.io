# More architecture

## Event Driven Architecture

**reactive programming** is a
[declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming")
[programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm")
concerned with
[data streams](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)> "Stream (computing)")
and the propagation of change

*reactive* programming: a:= b+ c where a is automatically
updated whenever b or c changes. In MVC, model changes
will be reflected in an associated view.

**Gerrit Dashboard?**

## What Is Blocking?

*blocking* means the flow of execution is blocked waiting for a process to complete

## What Is Non-Blocking?

The ***non-blocking*** approach facilitates *IO Input-Output* intensive operations.
Besides the disk & other the hardware-based operations, communication and network operations also
come under the *IO* operations.

***CPU intensive* & *IO intensive***

*Non-blocking* architecture is also known as the *Reactive* or the *Event-driven* architecture

Technologies like *NodeJS*, frameworks in the
*Java* ecosystem like *Play*, *[Akka.io](http://akka.io/)*
are *non-blocking* in nature and are built for modern high *IO* scalable applications.

They enable us to write code without worrying about handling
 *multi-threads, thread lock, out of memory issues* due to high *IO* etc.

### Node.js

- Real-time applications (chat, feeds)
- Event-driven architecture
- Can perform client-server duties (e.g. serve files), but not well-suited for this
- Database management, testing tools, etc, available as additional packages

### Play

- Client-server applications (website, services)
- Share-nothing architecture
- Can perform real-time duties (e.g. Websockets), but not well-suited for this
- Database management (including migrations!), testing tools, etc, built into core
