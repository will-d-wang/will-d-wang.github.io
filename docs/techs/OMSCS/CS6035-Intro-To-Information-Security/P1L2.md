Required Reading: [The protection of information in computer systems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15wLFyxKD_qkYybFtk_00WZxUNjgPbcesWB0XroQeHtg/edit?usp=sharing)

Required Reading 2: [A study on the Morris Worm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07647.pdf)

## Software vulnerabilities and how attackers exploit them

Buffer overflow

Stacks are used

* Function/procedure calls
* allocation of memory for
  * local variables
  * parameters
  * control information (return address)

## Defenses against attacks that try to exploit buffer overflows

## Security programming

* code "defensively", expecting it to be exploited;
* do not trust the user "input".
