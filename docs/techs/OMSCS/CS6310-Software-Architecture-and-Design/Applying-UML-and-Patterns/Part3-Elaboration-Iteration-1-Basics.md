## Chapter 8

## Chapter 13 Logical Architecture and UML Package Diagrams

### Layer design

- UI layer
- application logic(domain) layer

### What is the Logical Architecture? And Layers?

The logical architecture is the large-scale organization of the software classes into
packages (or namespaces), subsystems, and layers.

## Chapter 15 UML Interaction Diagrams

## What's the purpose?

Illustrate how objects interact via messages, used for dynamic object modeling.

### Sequence and Communication Diagrams

**Sequence diagrams** illustrate interactions in a kind of **fence** format.

- It's closer to UML specification
- Mapping to call-flow sequence from reading top to bottom
- reverse-engineered call-flow sequence from source code.

**Communication diagrams** illustrate object interactions in a **graph** or **network** format, in which objects can be placed anywhere on the diagram.

- "UML as sketch" for agile modeling.
- Simpler
- Easier to add new objects.

| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   sequence    | clearly shows sequence or time ordering of messageslarge set of detailed notation options | forced to extend to the right when adding new objects; consumes horizontal space |
| communication | space economical—flexibility to add new objects in two dimensions | more difficult to see sequence of messagesfewer notation options |

## Chapter 17 GRASP: Design objects with responsibilities

GRASP: [General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design))

Nine GRASP Patterns:

- Creator(Factory)
- Information Expert(Information hiding)
- Controller(Command, Facade, Layers)
- High Cohesion
  - **Cohesion** (or more specifically, functional cohesion) is a measure of how strongly related and focused the responsibilities of an element are.

- Low coupling
  - **[*Coupling*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applying-uml-and/0131489062/go01.html#gloss01entry22)** is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements.
- Indirection
- Polymorphism
- Protected variations
- Pure fabrication
