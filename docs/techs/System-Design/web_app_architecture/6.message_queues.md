## Messaging protocols

[AMQP Advanced Message Queue Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol)
&
[STOMP Simple or Streaming Text Oriented Message Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protocol)

## Technologies

*RabbitMQ*, *ActiveMQ*, *Apache Kafka*, ZeroMQ

## Case study: notification systems&Real-time feeds

**How to implement this notifcation system?**

They involve machine learning, understanding the user behaviour,
recommending new relevant information & integration of other modules with them

### Pull-based approach

Two major issues:
