## Chapter 2

## What's Design?

Design is both

- "the process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and
other characteristics of a system or component"
- the result of the above process.

## Design steps

- Generate various models
- Analyze and evaluate their solutions and tradeoffs according to requirements.
- Use resulting model to plan system verification, validation, construction and testing.

A wicked problem is a problem with no definitive solution.
