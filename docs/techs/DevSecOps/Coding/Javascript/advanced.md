## Regular expression

### Syntax

#### Brackets

Patterns that find a range of characters in the string

* [...] Any of the characters encapsulated.
* [^...] Not any character encapsulated.
* [0-9]
* [a-z]

#### Quantifiers

Special characters or flags that specify the position or frequency of a certain pattern

##### Frequency

* p+ one or more times
* p* zero or more times
* p? maximum once
* p\{n\} in a sequence n times
* p\{m,n\} minimum m times and max n times

##### Positional

* ^p p should exist at the start of the string
* p$ p should exist at the end of the string.

#### Lookaround

Assertions that see if a character match is possible or not, and accordingly return boolean values without consuming any part of the string.

* $p(?=q)$ Assert that p should be immediately be followed by q
* $p(?!q)$ Assert that p should NOT be immediately followed by q
* $p(?<=q)$ Assert that p should immediately be preceded by q
* $p(?<!q)$ Assert that p should NOT immediately be preceded by q

#### Character literals

representations for characters and special characters.

* Alphanumeric Any alphabet or numeric character itself e.g. a is any character which is the letter a
* \0 A null character
* \t A tab character
* \n A newline character
* \v A vertical tab character
* \f A form feed character (next page character)
* \r A carriage return character

#### Metacharacters

character representations for a group of characters falling under the same categories.

* . Any single character ([^\n])
* \s A white space character like tab and spaces ([ \n\r\t\f])
* \S Any character which is not a white space character ([^ \n\r\t\f])
* \d Any numeric character ([0-9])
* \D Any non-numeric character ([^0-9])
* \w Any word character ([a-zA-Z0-9_])
* \W Any non-word character ([^a-zA-Z0-9_])

### RegExp object

#### exec method

It runs the regular expression on a string passed as an argument and returns the found text as an object

#### test method

It runs the regular expression on a string passed as an argument and returns a boolean value telling if a match was found or not.

### String methods with RE

#### Search method

It takes a query-string as an argument and searches within the string to return the character index at which the query-string starts. It returns “-1” if no match is found.

#### replace method

It takes a query-string as an argument and searches within the string to replace the matching substring.

### RE example

```javascript
// Check if the password is strong password.
// Length: .{6,} (Minimum 6 characters)
// Uppercase letter: .*[A-Z] (A-Z)
// Lowercase letter: .*[a-z] (a-z)
// Numeric digit: .*\d (0-9)
// Special Character: .*[\W] (any character other than {0-9, a-z, A-Z})
var isSafe = function(password)
{
    var regex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[\W]).{6,}$/; 
    return regex.test(password); // return regex.test(password) after completing regex
}
```
