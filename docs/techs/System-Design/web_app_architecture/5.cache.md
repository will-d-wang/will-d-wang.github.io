# Caching

Why?It ensures *low latency* and *high throughput*.

What? Disk-based -> RAM(Random Access Memory)

## **Caching Dynamic Data**

It has expiry time or TTL. Cache invalidation to purse expired data.

## Caching static data

Images, Font files, CSS. Not changed often. CDNS

## Application architecture cache can be used

***cross-module communication*** in a *microservices* architecture by saving the shared data

a backbone for the ***microservice* communication**.

***Used in in-memory data stream processing* and running *analytics*.**

## Case study: Deployment costs reduction

Caching the writes in Memchae thendo a batch operations to update DB. **(Write-back strategy)**

## Caching strategies

### Cache Aside

*lazy-loaded*,  the cache works along with the database trying to reduce the hits on it as much as possible

### Read-Through

the cache always stays consistent with the database.

### Write-Through

each & every information written to the database goes through the cache.
Before the data is written to the DB, the cache is updated with it.

### Write-Back

In the *Write-back* caching strategy the data is directly written to the cache instead of the database.
And the cache after some delay as per the business logic writes data to the database.
