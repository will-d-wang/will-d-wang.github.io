# [Rabindranath Tagore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore)

**不是锤的打击，而是水的载歌载舞，使鹅卵石臻于完美。**

Not hammer-strokes, but dance of the water sings the pebbles into perfection.

**如果错过太阳时你流了泪，那么你也要错过群星了。**

If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.

**天空中没有翅膀的痕迹，但鸟儿已然飞过。**

I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.

**鸟儿愿为一朵云，云儿愿为一只鸟。**

The bird wishes it were a cloud. The cloud wishes it were a bird.

**群星不会因为像萤火虫，而怯于出现。**

The stars are not afraid to appear like fireflies.

**当你把所有的错误都关在门外，真理也就被拒绝了。**

If you shut your door to all errors truth will be shut out.

**你看不见你自己，你所看见的只是你的影子。**

What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow.

**月儿把光明遍照在天上，却把黑斑留给自己。**

The moon has her light all over the sky, her dark spots to herself.

**离我们最近的地方，路程却最遥远。我们最谦卑时，才最接近伟大。**

We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility.

**过去的浮云，已不再带来骤雨狂风，而是装点了我的落日晴空。**

Clouds come floating into my life from other days no longer to shed rain or
usher storm but to give colour to my sunset sky.
