## What's polymorphism?

[Polymorphism (computer science)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)>)

- _[Ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism)_: defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types.
- _[Parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism)_: not specifying concrete types and instead use abstract symbols that can substitute for any type.
- _[Subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping)_ (also called _subtype polymorphism_ or _inclusion polymorphism_): when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass.
