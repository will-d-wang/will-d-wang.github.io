## Why is it important in DevSecOps?

> In the case of DevSecops, the CI  server triggers the security tools in different phases (e.g. Static Code Analysis, Dynamic Analysis, etc) and stores the logs/reports.  

## Software Composition Analysis

### SCA Tools

- [Retire.js: Finding Vulnerable Libraries](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)
- [OSSAudit: Auditing Python Packages](https://github.com/illikainen/ossaudit)
- [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)
- [Blackduck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/)

## Compliance as Code(CAC)

### Why is CAC important in DevSecOps?

> The Compliance as Code phase makes the compliance a part of the DevSecOps
> pipeline and ensures that on every release, the test server adheres to the
> security policies defined for the project. This reduces the attack surface and obviously helps with becoming compliance-ready.

#### CAC Tools

- [Inspec: Automating Compliance Checks](https://github.com/inspec/inspec)
- [ServerSpec: Automating Configuration Tests](https://github.com/mizzy/serverspec)
