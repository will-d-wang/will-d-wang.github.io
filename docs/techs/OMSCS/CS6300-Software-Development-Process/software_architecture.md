# Software Architecture(SWA)

## Interview of Nenad Medvidovic

Software Architecture: Foundations, Theory, and Practice 2009. Wiley, ISBN 978-0-470-16774-8

## Software Erosion

## What's is software Architecture?

Perry and Wolf
SWA = `{Elements(What), Form(How), Rationale(why)}`

Shaw and Garland.
SWA is a level of design that involves

* Description of elements from which systems are built
* Interactions among those elements
* Patterns that guide their composition
* Constraints on these patterns

## A general definition of SWA

A Set of principal design decisions about the system.

## Prescriptive Architecture

It captures the design decisions prior to the system's construction.
As-Conceived SWA.

Prescriptive Arch should be modified first. However, this rarely happens.

* Developers' sloppiness
* Short deadlines
* Lack of documented prescriptive architecture.

## Descriptive Architecture

It describes how the system has actually been built.
As implemented SWA.

## Architectural Degradation

### Arch drift

Introduced orthogonal decisions to a system's prescriptive architecture.

### Arch erosion

Introduced decisions violated a system's prescriptive architecture.

## Arch. Elements

A software architecture typically is not a monolith.

### Components

* Processing elements: implement business logic and perform transformation on data.
* Date elements (information/state):
  elements contained information that is used in processing elements.

#### Software Components

* Encapsulates a subset of the system's functionality and/or data.
* restrict access to that subset via an explicitly defined interface.

### Connectors

* Interaction elements: glue that holds different pieces together.

#### Software connector: architectural entity affecting and regulating interaction

### Arch. configuration

Association between components and connectors of a software architecture.

## Architecture styles

* Pipe and filters: Unix commands,
* Event Driven: GUI
* Publish-subscribe: Twitter
* Client-Server : email
* Peer-to-peer
* REST
