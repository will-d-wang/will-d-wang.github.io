## Problems

- How to validate the feature requirements?
- How to build confidence about our product?

## Testing Techniques

- Parametrized testing - Data Driven Testing
- Behavior Driven testing.

## Python

- [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) - Plugin-based test framework.
- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - automate and standardize testing in Python
- [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)
- [pexpect](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect) - Expect-like module, a better tool for controlling other applications.
- [paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko) - SSH client and server functionality

## Java Family

- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) used for Spring based application with Mockito
- [Spock for Groovy](https://spockframework.org/)
- [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), Selenium IDE, Selenium Python Bindings.
- [NextNG](https://github.com/cbeust/testng), general testing and Web Automation (Selenium)
- [Unit Testing Spring Boot](https://reflectoring.io/unit-testing-spring-boot/)

[JUnit 5 vs TestNG](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38273479/junit-5-vs-testng)

## Dynamic Application Security Analysis (DAST)
>
> The Dynamic Application Security Analysis (DAST) is performed to identify the possible run-time vulnerabilities or security issues. Unlike static analysis, dynamic analysis is performed on a running project.

- [jmeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)

## A/B Testing

A/B testing is essentially **an experiment where two or more variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal**.

## Canary Testing

Canary Testing is **a way to reduce risk and validate new software by releasing software to a small percentage of users**.
